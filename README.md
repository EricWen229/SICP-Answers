# SICP-Solutions

Solutions to exercises in SICP

This is my personal collection of solutions to exercises in SICP.
Basically NONE of these solutions are guaranteed to be 100% correct
or the most effective (for better solutions please refer to
websites like http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions, which
are hosted and maintained by a bunch of more experienced guys), and
they are NOT supposed to be, since they're simply my own thoughts
and practices in the course of reading this book. This collection
will keep getting updated till the end, but I'm really unsure of
the schedule. Later (after I've finished reading this book and
completed all the exercises) I might go through this book again
for multiple times and refine these solutions based on my latest
reflection.

## Update: 2018-9-11

I've been thinking about whether to thoroughly test each piece of code
and I've added tests for some of the solutions. But in the end I decide
to stop doing so. There're a couple of reasons for this. First of all
the main purpose of reading this book and doing exercises is to understand
the ideas, not to write industrial-level code. Also, it takes too much time
and effort to write supporting code in order for the core part to run, and
to be tested. Nevertheless, I will still include some test cases in the
solutions.

## Update: 2018-12-27

Finally finished chapter 3 before 2019 comes. To me this is by far the most
mind-bending part of the book, and I still haven't been able to find out an
intuitive way of think about streams with my mind tangled up with closures,
lazy evaluation and memoization.
