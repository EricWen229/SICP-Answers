\section{Exercise 4.1}

Code:

\begin{lstlisting}
;; left to right version
(define (list-of-values exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (let ((first (eval (first-operand exps) env)))
        (cons first
              (list-of-values (rest-operands exps) env)))))

;; right to left version
(define (list-of-value exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (let ((rest (list-of-values (rest-operands exps) env)))
        (cons (eval (first-operand exps) env)
              rest))))
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Exercise 4.2}

\subsection{a.}

The evaluator will regard \lstinline{(define x 3)} as procedure
application instead of variable definition. Essentially this is
because there lacks a robust way of distinguish different types
of expressions.

\subsection{b.}

Feel sorry for you Louis, really. I understand your feeling.

Code:

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (application? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'call))
(define (operator exp) (cadr exp))
(define (operands exp) (cddr exp))
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Exercise 4.3}

Code:

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (eval exp env)
  ((get 'eval (type exp)) exp env))
(define type car)
(define content cdr)

;; sample evaluation rule
(let ((eval-if
       (lambda (exp env)
               (if (true? (eval (if-predicate exp) env))
                   (eval (if-consequent exp) env)
                   (eval (if-alternative exp) env)))))
  (put 'eval 'if eval-if))                
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Exercise 4.4}

\subsection{Syntax definition}

Code:

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (and? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'and))
(define and-clauses cdr)

(define (or? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'or))
(define or-clauses cdr)

(define no-clauses? null?)
(define first-clause car)
(define rest-clauses cdr)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Special form evaluation}

Code:

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (eval-and exp env)
  (define (eval-and-clauses clauses)
    (cond ((no-clauses? clauses) #t)
          ((true? (eval (first-clause clauses) env))
           (eval-and-clauses (rest-clauses clauses)))
          (else #f)))
  (eval-and-clauses (and-clauses exp)))

(define (eval-or exp env)
  (define (eval-or-clauses clauses)
    (cond ((no-clauses? clauses #f))
          ((true? (eval (first-clause clauses) env)) #t)
          (else (eval (rest-clauses clauses env)))))
  (eval-or-clauses (or-clauses exp)))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Derived form evaluation}

Code:

\begin{lstlisting}
;; transform AST-and to AST-if
(define (and-to-if exp)
  (define (expand-clauses clauses)
    (if (no-clauses? clauses)
        'true
        (make-if (first-clause clauses)
                 (expand-clauses (rest-clauses clauses))
                 'false)))
  (expand-clauses (and-clauses exp)))

;; transform AST-or to AST-if
(define (or-to-if exp)
  (define (expand-clauses clauses)
    (if (no-clauses? clauses)
        'false
        (make-if (first-clause clauses)
                 'true
                 (expand-clauses (rest-clauses clauses)))))
  (expand-clauses (or-clauses exp)))
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Exercise 4.5}

One thing worthy of noticing is that the recipient
procedure is invoked on the value of the expression
(result of evaluating it), not the expression itself.
The expression is only evaluated once, after which
its value is used for both branching and possibly
recipient. Thus the condition branch
\lstinline{(#test-exp => #recipient)} should be
transformed to the following expression:

\begin{lstlisting}
(let ((exp-value #test-exp))
  (if exp-value
      (#recipient exp-value)
      ;; other branches
))
\end{lstlisting}

This introduces the same problem as macros do. The local
variable \lstinline{exp-value} could introduce name conflict
with another variable named \lstinline{exp-value} in other branches,
therefore shadow the previous definition of that variable.
And, the variable binding of \lstinline{exp-value}
isn't supposed to leak into other branches and possibly
let expressions in other branches refer to it, which should've
caused an unbound variable error.

The problem seems inevitable. One way to tackle it is to use the
same technique as macros to avoid name conflict. Another way is
to treat \lstinline{cond} expressions as a special form and
make the intermediate variable \lstinline{exp-value} only exist
at runtime (during the evaluation of the \lstinline{cond}
expression).
